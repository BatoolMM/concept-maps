# Concept Maps

-   All diagrams are created with diagrams.net,
    which can be [used online](https://app.diagrams.net/)
    or [downloaded](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v13.6.2)
    from [the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio)
    (approximately 100MB).

-   Please save the `.drawio` file and also export an SVG by selecting everything
    and then using these settings:
    -   Zoom: 100%
    -   Border Width: 4 pixels
    -   Transparent Background
    -   Selection Only
        -   Crop

    Do *not* select "Shadow", "Embed Images", or "Include a copy of my diagram".

-   Show concepts with rounded rectangles:
    -   1pt black outline
    -   No fill
    -   12pt Helvetica font
    -   If there is a central concept:
        -   3pt black outline
        -   Make text bold and italic

-   Show relationships with arrows:
    -   3pt dark gray lines (hex code #B3B3B3)
    -   12pt Helvetica
    -   No background for text
    -   Connect both ends to anchor points on concepts
    -   Move text as needed so that it does *not* lie on the line
